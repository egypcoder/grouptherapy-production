# GroupTherapy Record Label - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based**: Drawing inspiration from major record labels (Interscope Records, Def Jam) and modern music platforms (Apple Music, BBC Sounds, Spotify) known for multimedia-rich interfaces with integrated players and dynamic content presentation.

**Key Principles**:
- Bold, oversized album art and hero imagery
- Clean editorial layouts with strong visual hierarchy
- Persistent player UX (sticky mini-player + expanded view)
- Media-first content presentation
- Dark mode optimized for music consumption experience

## Typography

**Font Families**:
- **Headlines**: Space Grotesk (700 weight for main titles, 600 for section headers)
- **Body**: Geist (400 regular, 500 medium for emphasis, 300 light for metadata)

**Scale** (mobile → desktop):
- Hero titles: text-4xl → text-6xl (bold, tight leading)
- Section headers: text-2xl → text-4xl
- Card titles: text-lg → text-xl
- Body text: text-base
- Metadata/labels: text-sm → text-base (light weight, uppercase tracking)

**Hierarchy**:
- Artist names and release titles: bold, high contrast
- Supporting info (dates, venues, genres): lighter weight, reduced opacity
- CTAs: medium weight, prominent sizing

## Layout System

**Spacing Primitives**: Use Tailwind units of **2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24** for consistent rhythm
- Component padding: p-4, p-6, p-8
- Section spacing: py-12 (mobile) → py-20 (desktop)
- Card gaps: gap-4, gap-6, gap-8
- Margins: m-4, m-6, m-8

**Grid System**:
- 12-column responsive grid
- Content max-width: max-w-7xl with px-4/6/8 horizontal padding
- Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)

**Viewport Usage**:
- Hero sections: 70-80vh with content overlay
- Content sections: Natural height, consistent py-12 → py-24
- Never force sections into rigid viewport constraints
